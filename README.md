# Interactive Awk Tutorial

__A work in process, occasionally worked on.__

There are countless [Awk tutorials](https://www.google.com/search?q=awk+tutorial) online, but I've ignored them all for years.

I decided to finally teach myself Awk and document the process in [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) with a Bash kernel. This is the result.

## (Tentative Outline)

1. [Basics of Awk](Lesson%2001%20Basics%20of%20Awk.ipynb)
2. [Built-in Functions](Lesson%2002%20Built%20in%20Functions.ipynb)
3. Arrays
4. ...
5.
### Appendices

1. [Other Tools](Appendix%2001%20Other%20Tools.ipynb)


## Running the notebooks:

To setup environment:

* `$ conda env create`
* `$ python -m bash_kernel.install`
